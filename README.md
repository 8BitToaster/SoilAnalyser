# SoilAnalyser
Machine Learning asks 4 questions and determines the type of soil


Will ask you 4 questions, about a ball test, ribbon test, and grittiness/smoothness.
Each of these tests you can find here: https://youtu.be/Ox-60VsJWys

There is also a checkpoints folder which has a pre-traind 1000 epoch model if you just want to use the modelTesting file
